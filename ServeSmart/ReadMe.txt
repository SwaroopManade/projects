restaurant web application using Spring Boot and React.js

### 1. **Backend Design (Spring Boot)**
   - **Entity Design**: Create entities like `Dish`, `Table`, `Order`, and `Bill`. These entities should have relationships:
     - `Dish` can have fields like `id`, `name`, `price`.
     - `Table` can have fields like `id`, `tableNumber`, `status` (occupied, vacant).
     - `Order` can have fields like `id`, `table`, `dishes` (many-to-many relationship), `totalAmount`.
     - `Bill` can have fields like `id`, `order`, `amountPaid`, `paymentStatus`.
   - **Service Layer**: Implement services to handle logic for adding dishes, creating orders, and generating bills.
   - **Controllers**: Set up controllers to handle requests like adding a new dish, creating an order for a table, and generating the final bill.
   - **REST APIs**: Define APIs such as:
     - `/dishes` (GET, POST, DELETE for managing dishes)
     - `/tables` (GET for viewing table status)
     - `/orders` (POST for placing orders for a table)
     - `/bills` (POST for generating a bill and marking a table as cleared)
   - **Database Schema**: Design a schema that accommodates the entities and relationships. Use JPA for ORM and MySQL or PostgreSQL as the database.

### 2. **Frontend Design (React.js)**
   - **Component Structure**: Create components like `DishList`, `TableList`, `OrderSummary`, `Billing`.
     - `DishList` can display all dishes with options to add/edit/delete.
     - `TableList` shows tables and their current status (vacant/occupied).
     - `OrderSummary` shows the current order for a table.
     - `Billing` displays the final bill for a table, with options to mark it as paid.
   - **State Management**: Use React hooks or a state management library like Redux to manage global state, such as table occupancy and current orders.
   - **Routing**: Implement React Router for navigation between pages like home, add dishes, place orders, and billing.
   - **UI Design**: Use a UI library like Material-UI or Bootstrap for styling. Keep it clean and intuitive for restaurant staff.

### 3. **Integration & Communication**
   - Use Axios or Fetch API for making HTTP requests from React to your Spring Boot backend.
   - Implement appropriate CORS configuration in Spring Boot to allow requests from your frontend.
   - Handle loading states and error messages gracefully on the frontend.

### 4. **Features to Focus On**
   - **Real-Time Updates**: Use WebSockets to show real-time updates if a tableâ€™s order is being prepared or served.
   - **Authentication & Authorization**: Add roles like `Admin` for adding/editing dishes and `Waiter` for placing orders.
   - **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling both on the client and server-side.
   - **Validation**: Validate user inputs such as dish prices, quantities, and table numbers on both frontend and backend.

### 5. **Testing & Deployment**
   - **Unit Testing**: Write JUnit tests for the backend service layer.
   - **Frontend Testing**: Use tools like Jest and React Testing Library to test the frontend components.
   - **Deployment**: Consider deploying the frontend on Netlify or Vercel, and the backend on platforms like Heroku or AWS.

By focusing on these aspects, you can create a robust application that is user-friendly and efficiently manages restaurant operations.
